# User stories

This app has five user stories, with some general demands towars the app. It describes the most important
functions and usages we wantes to implement. Every modifications we have done has been about making these
scenarios run as smooth as possible.

## As a user I want to be able to take quizzes so I can use the main function of the app (us-1)

The main idea behind this app is that you can take quizzes. Quiz is a popular game around the world, and
we wanted to provide quizzes for users to take. The user has the opportunity to choose between a number 
of quizzes. Each quiz contains three questions, and four answer alternatives per question. Ater the user
takes a quiz, they get a score. Also to keep the app interesting, the users can also make their own quizzes, 
that will pop up as a choice for all the users.
